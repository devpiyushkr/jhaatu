                    C++ was initially known as “C with classes, ” and it was renamed C++ in 1983. <br>
                    <b> ++ </b> means <b> +1 </b> in programming, therefore C++ roughly means that “one higher than C”.
                </p><br>

                <p>C++ is a kind of programming language that mixes both low-level and high-level aspects, making it a
                    middle-level language. It was created by a Danish computer scientist named Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell
                    Telephone Laboratories (now Nokia Bell Labs) in New Jersey. He wanted a language that had the
                    flexibility and dynamism of C, with additional features like active type checking, basic
                    inheritance, default function arguments, classes, and inlining. So, he came up with C with Classes,
                    which later became known as C++.</p>

        <h2>C with Classes</h2>

        <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming
            language. </p><br>
        <h3>Here's a brief history of C++:</h3>

        <br>
        <p><b>Origins (1979-1983): </b>C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, in the late
            1970s and early 1980s. Stroustrup started working on C++ in 1979 at Bell Labs, where he wanted to add
            object-oriented features to the C language. His aim was to create a language that would provide high-level
            abstractions while maintaining the efficiency of C.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>C++ as "C with Classes" (1983-1985): </b>The first edition of "The C++ Programming Language," Stroustrup's
            seminal book, was published in 1985. During this period, C++ was often referred to as "C with Classes"
            because it essentially extended the C language by adding classes, which are a fundamental feature of
            object-oriented programming.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Standardization (1989-1998): </b>C++ underwent a significant standardization process to solidify its
            features and syntax. The first international standard for C++ was published in 1998 and is commonly known as
            "C++98." This standardization effort helped ensure that C++ code could be written in a more portable and
            consistent manner across different platforms.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>C++11 (2011): </b>A major update to the C++ language, known as C++11, was released in 2011. This update
            introduced several new features and improvements, including auto keyword, range-based for loops, lambda
            expressions, smart pointers, and more. C++11 marked a significant step forward in making C++ more expressive
            and user-friendly.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Subsequent Standards (C++14, C++17, C++20): </b>Following C++11, several incremental updates to the
            language were released, known as C++14 and C++17. These updates introduced further enhancements and
            improvements. C++17, for example, brought features like std::optional, std::variant, filesystem library, and
            parallel algorithms. C++20, released in 2020, introduced additional features such as concepts, ranges,
            coroutines, and improvements to existing functionalities.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Ongoing Development (Beyond 2020): </b>Development of the C++ language continues, with new features and
            improvements being proposed and added. The C++ Standards Committee regularly meets to discuss and
            incorporate changes into the language. Future versions of C++ are expected to bring more features and
            enhancements, addressing both language-level and library-level improvements.</p>
