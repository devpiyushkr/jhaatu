        <h1>C++ - Download & Installation</h1>
        <div class="column-box">
            <p>There are so many compilers available for C++. You need to download any one. Here, we are going to use
                MinGW Compiler. It will work for both C and C++.<br>To install the MinGW Compiler, you need to follow
                following steps.</p>

        <h2>Follow the below Screenshots</h2>



        <h2>1. Simple</h2>
        <p>C++ is a simple language because it provides a structured approach (to break the problem into parts), a rich
            set of library functions, data types, etc.</p><br>

        <h2>2. Portability</h2>
        <p>C++ is a portable language and programs made in it can be run on different machines. It is also known as
            Machine Independent.</p><br>

        <h2>3. Fast</h2>
        <p>C++ programs tend to be compact and run quickly. Hence the compilation and execution time of the C++ language
            is fast.
        <p><br>

        <h2>4. Compiler Based</h2>
        <p>C++ is a compiler-based programming language, which means no C++ program can be executed without compilation.
            C++ compiler is easily available, and it requires very little space for storage. First, we need to compile
            our program using a compiler, and then we can execute our program.</p><br>

        <h2>5. Dynamic Memory Allocation</h2>
        <p>When the program executes in C++ then the variables are allocated the dynamical heap space. Inside the
            functions, the variables are allocated in the stack space. Many times, We don't know how much memory is
            needed to store particular information in a variable soo the size of required memory can be expands
            dynamicaly at run time.</p><br>

        <h2>6. Recursion</h2>
        <p>In C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code reusability for every function. This
            is very Interesting topic you can explore it and experiment it by your self for Better Understanding.<br> We
            will see it in Depth Later in this Tutorial.</p><br>

        <h2>7. Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>In C++, object-oriented concepts like data hiding, encapsulation, and data abstraction can easily be
            implemented using keyword class, private, public, and protected access specifiers. Object-oriented makes
            development and maintenance easier.</p><br>

        <h2>8. Rich Library</h2>
        <p>C++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that make the development fast.<br>Some of these are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>&lt iostream &gt</li>
            <li>&lt cmath &gt</li>
            <li>&lt cstdlib &gt</li>
            <li>&lt fstream &gt</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h2>9. Mid-Level Programming</h2>
        <p>C++ is a programming language that combines both low-level and high-level features, earning it the title of a
            mid-level or intermediate programming language. It is commonly employed for creating system applications
            like kernels and drivers.</p><br>

        <h2>10. Case Sensitive</h2>
        <p>C++ is a programming language that pays attention to uppercase and lowercase letters, which means it's
            case-sensitive. For instance, using <b>"cin"</b> is correct for taking input from the input stream, but
            using <b>"Cin"</b> won't work. In contrast, some other languages like HTML and MySQL are not case-sensitive;
            they don't care if you use uppercase or lowercase letters in the same way.</p><br>
