            <div>
                <p>C++ is a powerful and flexible programming language that evolved from the original C programming
                    language. Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s, C++ is widely used in various fields due
                    to its versatility and efficiency. The "++" in C++ symbolizes the language's evolutionary nature,
                    signifying improvements over its predecessor, C.
                </p><br>

                <p>C++ finds applications in diverse domains, ranging from system programming to game development,
                    embedded systems, high-performance computing, and more. It is the language behind many software
                    systems, game engines, operating systems (e.g., Windows), and critical applications requiring
                    efficient resource management.</p>

        <h2>What is C++</h2>
        <p>
            C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, meaning it supports the creation and manipulation of
            objects, allowing for modular and reusable code. It extends the procedural programming features of C, adding
            object-oriented concepts like classes and inheritance. This blend of procedural and object-oriented
            paradigms makes C++ suitable for a broad range of applications.
        </p>
        <p>C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Efficiency: </b>C++ is known for its emphasis on performance and efficiency, making it a preferred choice
            for resource-intensive tasks.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Portability: </b>It can run on various platforms with minimal modifications, enhancing cross-platform
            development.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Standard Template Library (STL): </b>C++ comes with the STL, a collection of tools that simplify common
            programming tasks, such as managing data structures and algorithms.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Community and Standards: </b>C++ has a vibrant community of developers, and its standards are continuously
            evolving, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different systems.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</h2>
        <p>C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object-oriented
            programming
            (OOPs) used in C++ are:</p>

        <p>1. Inheritance</p>
        <p>2. Polymorphism</p>
        <p>3. Encapsulation</p>
        <p>4. Abstraction</p>
        <!-- <ol type="1">
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
        </ol> -->


        <br>
        <h2>Usage of C++</h2>
        <p>1.Window application</p>
        <p>2.Client-Server application</p>
        <p>3.Device drivers</p>
        <p>4.Embedded firmware etc</p>
